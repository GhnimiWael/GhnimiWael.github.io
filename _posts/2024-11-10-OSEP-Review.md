# OffSec Experienced Penetration Tester (OSEP)
The OffSec Experienced Penetration Tester (OSEP) certification is a significant step in Advanced Penetration Testing. This certification targets professionals in mature security environments where the goal is often to bypass sophisticated defenses. The OSEP exam spans nearly two full days (47 hours and 45 minutes), requiring candidates to reach a score of 100 points (`10 Flags`) to pass or reach the `secret.txt` flag, as second way to pass. Following the exam, candidates have an additional day to complete a reportâ€”a critical skill for any experienced penetration tester, covering both practical and analytical aspects of the role.

## Introduction
Welcome to __Reverse Engineering Resources__ !

These are the reverse engineering resources I’ve used, seen used by others, and believe can be really useful if you want to break into reverse engineering. Whether you're analyzing binaries, finding vulnerabilities, or just curious about how software works, these books, tools, and courses will help you get started.

## Programming Languages

In the discussion between George Hotz and Lex Fridman about programming languages that everyone should learn, they emphasize the importance of Assembly and C. 

{% include embed/youtube.html id='XlvfHOrF26M' %}

These languages provide a deep understanding of how computers work at a low level, enabling programmers to grasp memory management, system architecture, and performance optimization. Learning Assembly helps in understanding how instructions are executed by the CPU, while C serves as a foundation for operating systems, embedded systems, and performance-critical applications. Mastering these languages gives programmers a strong technical edge and a better appreciation of higher-level programming concepts.

{% include embed/youtube.html id='wLXIWKUWpSs' %}

1. Intro to x86 Assembly Language (Part 1)
    - Makefile
    ```bash
	nasm -f elf32 exY.asm -o exY.o
	ld -m elf_i386 exY.o -o exY
    ```
    - Exerice 1:

    ```nasm
    global _start
    _start:
        mov eax, 1  ; exit system call
        mov ebx, 42 ; exist status (can be any integer)
        sub ebx, 29 ; substruct 29 from ebx register
        int 0x80  ; perform an interrupt (0x80 interrupt handler for System call) => Transfer control to the Kernel

        ; sub ebx, 1
        ; sub: Operation
        ; ebx, 1: [operands, ...]

        ; Operations
        ; mov ebx, 123 => ebx = 123
        ; mov eax, ebx => ax = ebx
        ; add ebx, ecx => ebx += ecx
        ; sub ebx, edx => ebx -= edx
        ; mul ebx      => ebx *= ebx
        ; div edx      => edx /= edx
    ```
    - Exercice 2:

    ```nasm
    ; global => Entry point for the program, Has to be declared for the Linker
    global _start

    ; here is the data that can be referenced on the code by name
    section .data
        msg db "Hello, world!", 0x0a
        ; 0x0a => Hex for 10 and it's the "Newline" (like \n)
        ; db => Define byte, allow to store the msg as string
    
        len equ $ - msg
        ; Determine the length of string:
            ; the $ means the current address according to the assembler.
            ; $ - msg is the current address of the assembler minus the address of msg

    section .text
    _start:
        ; the _start where the code should live !
        mov eax, 4  ; sys_write system call
        mov ebx, 1  ; stdout file descriptor
        mov ecx, msg; bytes to write
        mov edx, len; number of bytes to write
        int 0x80    ; perform system call (interrupt for the system call)
        
        mov eax, 1  ; sys exit system call
        mov ebx, 0  ; exist status is 0
        int 0x80
    ```

2. Intro to x86 Assembly Language (Part 2)
    - Exercice 3:
        - Non-Conditioned branch:

        ```nasm
        global _start

        section .text
        _start:
            mov ebx, 42 ; exist status is 42
            mov eax, 1  ; sys_exit system call
            jmp skip    ; jump to "skip" label
            mov ebx, 13 ; exist status is 13
                ; PoC: if the jmp does work the exist status code will remain as 42 instead of change to 13
        skip:
            int 0x80    ; perform the interrrupts to exist the program
        ```

        - Conditioned branch:

        ```nasm
        global _start

        section .text

        _start:
            mov ecx, 99 ; set ecx to 99
            mov ebx, 42 ; exist status is 42
            mov eax, 1  ; sys_exit system call
            cmp ecx, 100; compare ecx to 100
            jl skip    ; jump "if less" of the previous line => to "skip" label
            mov ebx, 13 ; exist status is 13

        skip:
            int 0x80

        ; Common conditional jumps
            ;  je   A, B  ; Jump if Equal
            ;  jne  A, B  ; Jump if Not Equal
            ;  jg   A, B  ; Jump if Greater
            ;  jge  A, B  ; Jump if Greate or Equal
            ;  jl   A, B  ; Jump if Less
            ;  jle  A, B  ; Jump if Less or Equal
        ```

    ```nasm
    ; Build a loop using Jump Instructions

    global _start

    section .text
    _start:
        mov ebx, 1  ; start ebx at 1
        mov ecx, 4  ; number of iterations

    label:
        add ebx, ebx; ebx += ebx
        dec ecx     ; ecx -= 1
        cmp ecx, 0  ; compare ecx to 0

        mov [addr], byte 'H' ; [ ] means we are moving some data into that address, going to change first letter of the string only
        mov [addr+5], byte '!' ; move 5 into that address + offset of 5
        
        mov eax, 4  ; sys_write system call
        mov ebx, 1  ; stdout file descriptor
        mov ecx, addr; bytes to write

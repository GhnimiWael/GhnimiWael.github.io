## Introduction
Welcome to __Reverse Engineering Resources__ !

These are the reverse engineering resources I’ve used, seen used by others, and believe can be really useful if you want to break into reverse engineering. Whether you're analyzing binaries, finding vulnerabilities, or just curious about how software works, these books, tools, and courses will help you get started.

## 1. Programming Languages

In the discussion between George Hotz and Lex Fridman about programming languages that everyone should learn, they emphasize the importance of Assembly and C.

These languages provide a deep understanding of how computers work at a low level, enabling programmers to grasp memory management, system architecture, and performance optimization. Learning Assembly helps in understanding how instructions are executed by the CPU, while C serves as a foundation for operating systems, embedded systems, and performance-critical applications. Mastering these languages gives programmers a strong technical edge and a better appreciation of higher-level programming concepts.
